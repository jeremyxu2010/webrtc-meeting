jshashtable
===========

A fork of the jshashtable and jshashset libraries hosted in https://code.google.com/p/jshashtable/. This project adds Bower metadata to be easily consumed by this package manager

### Description from Original Project Site

A standalone implementation of hash table in JavaScript. It associates keys with values, and allows any object to be used as the key (unlike JavaScript's built-in Object, which only allows strings as property names).

jshashtable requires no libraries and is designed to work in all ECMAScript 3 compliant environments, including all major browsers. In particular, it has been tested and works in:

Firefox (all versions, back to Phoenix 0.1)
Internet Explorer 5.5+
Safari 3+ (untested in previous versions)
Google Chrome (all versions)
Opera 7+
See the jshashtable website for full documentation.

Version 3.0 released
Version 3.0 is released today (16th July 2013). It fixes  issue 2 ,  issue 3 ,  issue 5 ,  issue 6 ,  issue 7 , adds new equals() and toQueryString() methods and drops support for IE 5.0. Also includes jshashset and documentation in the zip.
